# NFA-to-DFA
A C code that converts NFA to DFA

The code accepts transitions, i.e an input "0 1 2" means that the nfa has an edge between node "0" and "2", and that, this transition would occur when the input symbol is "1".

The code accepts a list of initial and final states as well
The output of the code includes a list of transitions for the generated DFA.
